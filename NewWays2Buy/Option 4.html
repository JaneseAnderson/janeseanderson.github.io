		You rush out of the Cafe, run the 12 blocks it takes to get to your house, search the living room, your bedroom and the bathroom, and finally find your wallet on the bathroom sink, you run the 12 blocks back to the cafe. Once you get there the line is out the door, you check your watch and realize you are 10 minutes late to your exam. You will have to wait another semester to take the exam again.
