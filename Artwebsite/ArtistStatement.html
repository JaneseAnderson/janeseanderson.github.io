<b>Artist Statement</b>
<p>The utilization of Pencil, Paint, Charcoal and Digital ink to create fantasy places and characters are where I find joy. The other realities that I design encompass my faith and beliefs and hopefully provide an escape for my viewers from their everyday troubles. My concentration is mainly in cartoons and comics however I am fond of occasionally using the human face and body to depict my art in real life.

If I am able to bring my viewers even a few minutes a day of peace and happiness after they have seen my art, then I will have fulfilled my purpose. </p>
