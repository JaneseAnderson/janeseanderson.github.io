	<b>New Ways to Buy</b>

	<p> After rolling out of bed this morning you decide to grab a coffee at a new cafe that your friend told you about last week. You are exhausted from a long night of studying and need a coffee to wake you up so that you can get through your 20 page Math exam that morning. The line for the cafe is short and once you get to the front you quickly tell the cashier your order. When you go to pay you realize you forgot your wallet at home. You start to panic because you have only 15 minutes to get to the exam hall and live too far to run and grab your wallet in under 15 minutes. The cashier sees you panicking and calmly says with a smile "It's ok this Cafe has different forms of payment" </p>
